# Google ADK Chat History Viewer

A standalone Next.js application for viewing and analyzing Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) chat session JSON files. For more information about Google ADK, see the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/).

## Features

- Upload and parse ADK session JSON files
- View conversation history with proper formatting
- Display function calls and their responses
- Download attached files from the chat session
- Support for PDF and other file types

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A supported Node.js LTS release (Node.js 24 recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
# or
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Usage

1. Export your ADK session as a JSON file
2. Upload the JSON file to the viewer
3. View the conversation, function calls, and attached files
4. Download any attached files as needed

## PDF export security

Markdown exports render with JavaScript and external network/file requests disabled.
Text, formatting and inline data images are supported; remote images and embedded
web pages are omitted. Run the PDF service as an unprivileged user in an environment
that supports Chromium's sandbox. Browser processes are closed after both successful
and failed renders.

## Testing PDF exports

After `npm ci` and `npm run build`, start a local production server with `npm start`.
Run the PDF integration checks with `PDF_TEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 npm run test:pdf`.
These checks launch Chromium through the application and verify PDF output, empty input,
and blocked image, frame, stylesheet, CSS, and script requests to a local canary server.
Set `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` on the application server if using an existing Chromium installation.
